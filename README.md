# Databricks Data Engineer Professional – Practitioner Study Guide

This repository accompanies a 6-week practitioner-led study guide for the Databricks Data Engineer Professional certification.

The focus is on system behavior, trade-offs, and production judgment—not syntax memorization.

## How to Use This Repo with the Substack Series

Each Substack post explains *why* certain decisions matter.
Each notebook here shows *what happens when you make them*.

Recommended flow:
1. Read the Substack post fully
2. Run the corresponding notebooks without modification
3. Observe system behavior
4. Re-read the scenario questions in the post

If the behavior surprises you, slow down—that is the exam signal.
